# AnyalizeTestLog
A C# desktop tool to read and extract useful information from large hardware test log file, using WPF, async/await 

This is a product environment tool. The log is generated by some other medical hardware testing tools.
A friend on the network is at the job to extract useful information from these large logs, 
and since not familiar with programming and came to me to help.
I'm interested in such text processing tool because it can be easily tested, verified, and can be exciting when
any performance issue resolved.
Howerver, I'm also not familiar with C# file processing especially large file and performance optimisim.
So after trying several times, I finally choosed .net 4.5 Async/Await, compiled Regex, as well as SubString methods.
I publish this project for other C# newbies to learn, and for senior C# programmers to try better ways,
both in stability, flexibility, and performance.
